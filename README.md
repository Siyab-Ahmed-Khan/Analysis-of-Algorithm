# Insertion Sort Time Calculator (C++)

## Overview

This C++ project implements the Insertion Sort algorithm and calculates the time it takes to sort an array. It is designed to give you insights into the performance of the algorithm based on different input sizes.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- A C++ IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, CLion, or Sublime Text)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository (if applicable)

If the project is hosted on GitHub, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

2. Set Up the Project
Open your C++ IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or any text editor).

Create a new C++ project or open the existing project folder if you're cloning from GitHub.

Add a new C++ file or open the existing one (e.g., InsertionSortTimeCalculator.cpp).

3. Add the Code
Copy the Insertion Sort code (including time calculation logic) and paste it into the C++ file.

4. Compile the Code
In your IDE, click on the "Build" or "Compile" option to compile the project.

If you're using a terminal, you can compile the code manually with the following command:

bash

g++ -o InsertionSortTimeCalculator InsertionSortTimeCalculator.cpp
5. Run the Program
After compiling, run the program. In your IDE, click "Run," or use the terminal with the following command:

bash

./InsertionSortTimeCalculator
6. View the Results
The program will execute and display the time taken to perform the Insertion Sort based on the input size.
